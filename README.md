Also known as Reese, I'm a second year university student with a year of development under my belt. I program whatever interests/bothers me at the moment.
<br><br>
Right now, I like <del><a href="https://kprofiles.com/mia-everglow-profile-facts/">Everglow's Mia</a>,</del> <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> and <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a>. I'm also familiar with Python, C++, and the HTML/CSS/JS stack.
<br><br>
When I'm not developing, I play rhythm games (and sometimes FPS games) and listen to music (you can find out my music taste <a href="https://www.last.fm/user/i-dle">here~</a>).
